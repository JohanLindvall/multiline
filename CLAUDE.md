# CLAUDE.md

Go library that rejoins multi-line log output (stack traces, panics) into
single logical entries, for use in log shippers. Dependency-free (testify is
test-only). Not safe for concurrent use by design; callers own goroutines and
I/O ("sans-IO").

## Commands

Use the Makefile (same shape as JohanLindvall/lightning):

- `make test` — full suite with coverage, including the corpus tests under
  `tests/`
- `make check` — golangci-lint (installed on demand) + test; keep it at 0
  issues
- `make fix` — gofmt + go mod tidy
- `make bench` — benchmarks (the no-match path must stay on the prefilter
  fast path, ~100ns/line; see below)
- `make fuzz` — 30s conservation-invariant fuzz burst
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) mirrors lightning: one check job per arch
  (amd64+arm64) running `make test`, lint once on amd64 via
  golangci-lint-action pinned to v2.12.2, and auto patch-tagging on green main

## Layout

- `multiline.go` — the engine: `Aggregator[T]`, per-key `group` buffers, an
  intrusive linked list in last-touched order (drives `FlushBefore`,
  `WithMaxGroups` eviction, and deterministic `Stop`), size caps, and
  longest-accepted-prefix emission
- `patterns/` — declarative state machines: `Compile(StateSet...)` builds the
  `StateMachine` that implements `multiline.Matcher` (structurally; patterns
  must not import the root package — the root imports patterns for the
  default matcher). One file per bundled format
- `cri/` — Kubernetes CRI partial-line rejoining as a stage in front of the
  root aggregator. Has its own hand-written `Matcher` and `Parse`; does not
  use regex. `cri.Next[T]` is deliberately signature-compatible with
  `(*multiline.Aggregator[T]).AddAt`
- `tests/<format>/*.txt` — corpus files, the behavioral spec

## Matcher semantics (the part worth re-reading)

- A group completes on a line that *lands in* an accepting state (a state
  without `NonTerminal`). Not "matched from" — that older semantics had an
  off-by-one that broke single-frame Java traces.
- On flush, the longest accepted prefix is emitted as one aggregated entry;
  lines consumed after it are re-emitted individually. A group never emits an
  aggregated entry spanning fewer than two source lines (first-line accepts
  are deliberately ignored).
- The emitted `Match` is the `StateSet.Name`, resolved via
  `Matcher.Format(acceptedStateIndex)`.
- State names are namespaced per set; only `patterns.StartState` is shared.
  Transitions may only reference states within the same set (or the start
  state).

## Corpus test format

First line: comma-separated expected entry sizes in source lines (e.g.
`1,10,1`). Rest: the log to feed, one group per expected size, in order.
Files must NOT end with a trailing newline unless the trailing empty line is
intentionally part of the last group (python.txt relies on this: the blank
after the error line is absorbed by the trace). Every file under `tests/` is
run through the *default* matcher, so corpora for non-default sets (CRI)
don't belong there — test those with `WithMatcher` unit tests instead.

## Gotchas

- Start-pattern prefilter (`patterns/prefilter.go`): Compile derives literal
  substrings from the start patterns (via regexp/syntax) so non-matching
  lines skip the regexes entirely. Every start pattern must keep a provable
  case-sensitive literal of >= 3 bytes, or the prefilter silently disables
  for the whole machine — `TestBundledPrefilterEnabled` guards this; keep it
  passing when adding formats. `TestPrefilterDifferential` proves the filter
  never changes a decision.

- `Truncated` reporting: when a capped group flushes, the flag is set on the
  aggregated entry if there is one, else on the last individually emitted
  line. The first line of a group is always retained (cut to `""` at worst) —
  this is what prevents the historical empty-group panic; don't "optimize" it
  away.
- `FlushBefore` assumes non-decreasing times across `Add`/`AddAt` calls (the
  linked list is only sorted if times are).
- Java's header pattern intentionally matches Node.js errors; the set is
  named `java` but covers both. Loose by design (fluent-bit parity).
- go.mod declares `go 1.22` (needs range-over-int); don't let tooling bump it
  to the local toolchain version, and don't use newer stdlib/testing APIs
  (e.g. `b.Loop`, `strings.SplitSeq`) without raising it deliberately.
